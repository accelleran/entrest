This is a fork of [lrstanley/entrest](https://github.com/lrstanley/entrest) with additional features.

For a complete list of changes and new features in this fork, see the [Fork Changelog](/entrest/resources/changelog/).

## Installation

To use this fork in your project, you have two options:

### Option 1: Using Go Module Replace (Recommended)

This approach maintains compatibility with the upstream module path, making it easier to switch back to upstream or merge upstream changes.

Add this to your `go.mod`:

```go
require github.com/lrstanley/entrest v1.0.2

replace github.com/lrstanley/entrest => github.com/accelleran/entrest v1.x.x
```

Then in your code, continue using the original import path:

```go
import "github.com/lrstanley/entrest"
```

### Option 2: Direct Import

Alternatively, if you change all your imports to use the fork directly:

```bash
go get github.com/accelleran/entrest@latest
```

```go
import "github.com/accelleran/entrest"
```

:::caution[Module Path Behavior]
Because this fork maintains the original module path in its `go.mod`, pkg.go.dev will redirect
`github.com/accelleran/entrest` to `github.com/lrstanley/entrest`. This is intentional and allows
for seamless use of `replace` directives.
