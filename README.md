## :sparkles: Features

**entrest** is an [EntGo](https://entgo.io/) extension for generating compliant OpenAPI
specs and an HTTP handler implementation that matches that spec. It expands upon the
approach used by [entoas](https://github.com/ent/contrib/tree/master/entoas#entoas),
with additional functionality, and pairs the generated specification with a
fully-functional HTTP handler implementation.

- :sparkles: Generates OpenAPI specs for your EntGo schema.
- :sparkles: Generates a fully functional HTTP handler implementation that matches the OpenAPI spec.
- :sparkles: Supports automatic pagination (where applicable).
- :sparkles: Supports advanced filtering (using query parameters, `AND`/`OR` predicates, etc).
- :sparkles: Supports eager-loading edges, so you don't have to make additional calls unnecessarily.
- :sparkles: Supports various forms of sorting.
- :sparkles: And more!
