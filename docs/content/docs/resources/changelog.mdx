This changelog documents changes made in the Accelleran fork of entrest. For upstream changes, see the [official entrest releases](https://github.com/lrstanley/entrest/releases).

## Version Format

Fork versions follow the pattern: `v{FORK_MAJOR}.{FORK_MINOR}.{FORK_PATCH}+upstream.{UPSTREAM_VERSION}`

Example: `v1.0.0+upstream.1.0.1` means fork version 1.0.0 based on upstream version 1.0.1.

**Note:** Tags without the `+upstream.` suffix (e.g., `v1.0.2`, `v1.0.1`) are upstream releases from [lrstanley/entrest](https://github.com/lrstanley/entrest), not fork releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Edges now inherit operations from parent entity** - When an entity has operations configured via `WithIncludeOperations` (e.g., `OperationUpsert`), its edges now automatically participate in those operations without requiring explicit annotations on each edge. The inheritance order is: edge's explicit operations → parent entity's operations → global defaults. This fixes the issue where enabling `OperationUpsert` on a singleton entity would still require annotating each edge separately.
- **JSON tag handling preserves existing options** - The internal `patchJSONTag` function now properly removes only the `omitempty` option from JSON tags while preserving other tag options and metadata, rather than replacing the entire struct tag

## [v1.1.1+upstream.1.0.2] - 2025-11-24

Based on upstream [entrest v1.0.2](https://github.com/lrstanley/entrest/releases/tag/v1.0.2).

### Fixed
- **Edges without backing fields now included in Upsert/Replace params** - Edges marked with `WithIncludeOperations(OperationUpsert)` or `WithIncludeOperations(OperationCreateOrReplace)` are now properly included in the generated parameter structs, even when they don't have explicit backing fields defined with `.Field()`. Previously, these edges were silently excluded, making it impossible to set required edges during upsert/replace operations.
- **Non-unique edges now replace instead of append in Upsert/Replace** - M2M and O2M relationships now correctly replace existing edge connections instead of appending to them, matching proper PUT semantics:
  - **Upsert (partial update)**: `{"pets": [3, 4]}` replaces with [3, 4], `{"pets": []}` clears all, omitting `pets` preserves existing
  - **Replace (full replacement)**: `{"pets": [3, 4]}` replaces with [3, 4], `{"pets": []}` or omitted clears all
  - Previously, providing edge IDs would append to existing relationships (e.g., `[1, 2]` + `[3, 4]` = `[1, 2, 3, 4]`), which violated REST PUT semantics

## [v1.1.0+upstream.1.0.2] - 2025-11-13

Based on upstream [entrest v1.0.2](https://github.com/lrstanley/entrest/releases/tag/v1.0.2).

### Added
- **Upsert operation** ([`OperationUpsert`](/entrest/openapi-specs/upsert-operations/#operationupsert-partial-updates)) - PUT endpoint with partial update semantics (preserves unprovided optional fields)
- **Create-or-Replace operation** ([`OperationCreateOrReplace`](/entrest/openapi-specs/upsert-operations/#operationcreateorreplace-full-replacement)) - PUT endpoint with full replacement semantics (clears unprovided optional fields)
- **Subentities** ([docs](/entrest/openapi-specs/subentities/)) - Schemas accessible only through parent edges, without top-level REST endpoints (useful for dependent/nested data like status objects, metadata, or configuration)
- **`WrapUnpagedResults` config option** ([docs](/entrest/openapi-specs/configuration/#wrapunpagedresults)) - Return objects instead of arrays for unpaged list operations

### Fixed
- [Eager loading](/entrest/openapi-specs/eager-loading/) now works for schemas with no operations configured
- [`WithExcludeOperations`](/entrest/openapi-specs/annotation-reference/#withexcludeoperations) now properly excludes operations from configured defaults
- Non-paginated list operations now return correct pointer types (related to [`WrapUnpagedResults`](/entrest/openapi-specs/configuration/#wrapunpagedresults))
- List endpoint response descriptions now use properly pluralized entity names

### Added
